# train-schedule

Step right up folks... Check out this made-up train schedule that calculates the time till the first train arrives using Moment JS!

Interested? Well, if you are... That's pretty crazy. Who reads this Readme anyway?

ANYWAY, add your train name, destination, first train time, and frequency and bam you got it inputted into Firebase.

P.S. the API key isn't clearly visible in the source code of the js file.
